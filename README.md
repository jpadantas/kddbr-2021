Using an enhanced Self-Organizing Map method, we provided suboptimal solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Besides, we employed hyperparameter tuning to identify the most critical features in the algorithm. All improvements in the benchmark work brought consistent results and may inspire future efforts to improve this algorithm and apply it to different problems.
